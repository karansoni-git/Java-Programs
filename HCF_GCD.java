/*GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), also known as HCF (Highest Common Factor), is the largest number that can exactly divide two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.

Example:
Find the GCD of 12 and 18

Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Common Factors: 1, 2, 3, 6
Greatest Common Factor (GCD) = 6 âœ…
